## About

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to load dependencies
Run `npm test` to ensure a stable build

This is only the front end client, so develop locally you'll need the backend server as well.
To get the backend up and running see [https://github.com/verdi327/bettr-server](https://github.com/verdi327/bettr-server)

Deployments are handled through Zeit and can be run via `npm run deploy`
